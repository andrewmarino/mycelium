# Mycelium

:mushroom: _my·ce·li·um_  `/mīˈsēlēəm/`

> A mycelium is the vegetative part of a fungus, and is made up of white or cream colored fungal threads or filaments that are known as hyphae. The size of a single mycelium ranges from being very minuscule to being as widespread as a forest. The branching mycelium masses, typically found underground, can form a massive network.

**Mycelium** is also the application I'm developing for keeping track of different fungi I find on my daily walks and hikes. Check the [active branches](https://github.com/andrewmarino/mycelium/branches) of this repository for progress.
